### Hi there! 😁

My name is Pedro Nandi from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Software Developer since 2012 and currently I'm Back-end Engineer at [FESC Tecnologia](https://www.fescsaude.com.br/). I'm passionate about coding, so I've been always learning. Here, I share some projects that I've made.

Would you like to find me?
